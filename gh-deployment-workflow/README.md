# Hello GitHub Actions

This repository is a simple example project to demonstrate the use of GitHub Actions. It contains a basic `index.html` file that displays the message "Hello, GitHub Actions!".

# Project Requirements

You are required to write a GitHub action that deploys any changes made to the index.html file to GitHub Pages. It should only deploy the file when the index.html file is changed.

## Files

- `index.html`: A simple HTML file that displays "Hello, GitHub Actions!" when opened in a browser.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to serve as a foundational repository that can be expanded with various GitHub Actions for CI/CD, testing, deployment, and more.
