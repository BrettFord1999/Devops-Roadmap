Wrapped up DNS server project in Python where I learned about analyzing, parsing and constructing network packets.
VPC lab completed on Kodekloud.
Started AWS Developer Associate study. Covered VPCs, EC2, S3 and Route53. I've worked with these all before but there were some gaps covered in formal training material.
11-20-2024
Jenkins architecture introduction and toolset
Worked on coding algorithms starting simple with array manipulation
Read some pygame documentation and setup the beginning of a project
11-21-2024
Completed more steps on the Asteroids game. Learning a lot about classes and inheritance.
Handling method overwrites so we can group together classes in containers and loop over them to update them with a singular method that does different things for each class
Had an idea for a monitoring project to collect time-series data and map it
used subprocess with Python
Development environments are starting to be more consistent because I'm using docker and virtual environments when possible
11-22-2024
completed some functional programing concepts on boot.dev
recursion, first class functions
watched a video covering all keywords and soft keywords in Python
11-23-2024
Learned about ternary operators, nice that you can tuple unpack to set multiple variables in clean one liners
Started building an http server
Learned about a few different error types regarding socket connections, especially regarding timeouts and blocking
learned about http packet creation and have started parsing out requests
leaning more towards a functional style as much as I can in here. when building my DNS server last time I unnecessarily used classes for everything and that overcomplicated it when I could have just done everything as a function.
