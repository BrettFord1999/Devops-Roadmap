Wrapped up DNS server project in Python where I learned about analyzing, parsing and constructing network packets.
VPC lab completed on Kodekloud.
Started AWS Developer Associate study. Covered VPCs, EC2, S3 and Route53. I've worked with these all before but there were some gaps covered in formal training material.

11-20-2024
Jenkins architecture introduction and toolset
Worked on coding algorithms starting simple with array manipulation
Read some pygame documentation and setup the beginning of a project

11-21-2024
Completed more steps on the Asteroids game. Learning a lot about classes and inheritance.
Handling method overwrites so we can group together classes in containers and loop over them to update them with a singular method that does different things for each class
Had an idea for a monitoring project to collect time-series data and map it
used subprocess with Python
Development environments are starting to be more consistent because I'm using docker and virtual environments when possible

11-22-2024
completed some functional programing concepts on boot.dev
recursion, first class functions
watched a video covering all keywords and soft keywords in Python

11-23-2024
Learned about ternary operators, nice that you can tuple unpack to set multiple variables in clean one liners
Started building an http server
Learned about a few different error types regarding socket connections, especially regarding timeouts and blocking
learned about http packet creation and have started parsing out requests
leaning more towards a functional style as much as I can in here. when building my DNS server last time I unnecessarily used classes for everything and that overcomplicated it when I could have just done everything as a function.
Learned basics of threading in Python, it's a lot simpler than I expected
Used this to manage multiple socket connected on my http server
today I actually completed the whole base project for an HTTP server. I have a lot better understanding of what actually goes on with API endpoints under the hood
in total the steps were:
port binding
creating response headers
parsing requests
creating logic depending on endpoints
managing concurrent connections with threading
managing files to serve file information
creating files from POST requests
Was great to complete this without LLM assistance. Only used documentation and stack overflow

11-24-2024
boot.dev lessons
algorithms in Python

11-25-2024
boot.dev functional section
Recursion, map, filtering, reduce
function transformations, Closures, Currying
I will need to revisit these until I can understand more use cases.

11-26-2024
Lots of boot.dev today
finished the functional section
Started the algorithms section

11-27-2024
binary search practice
more Big O concepts


11-28-2024
Thanksgiving
I feel bad that I wasn't able to study

11-29-2024
bubble sort, learned and wrote an implementation of it

11-30-2024
started on static site generator in Python
Algorithms have definitely been a wall so far so I'm going to get some momentum by completing a project
really looking forward to starting the GO section soon. I think I'm going to enjoy that more than Python.

12-1-2024
motivation has been tough
watched back end focused podcasts and Primeagen videos to at least stay immersed in software engineering culture.

12-2-2024
Did some Powershell scripting while teaching the basics to someone.
API calls on network devices for conditional configuration.
Seeing as my current goals are more aligned to Devops rather than a software engineering position I'm going to move back to KodeKloud.

12-3-2024
ServiceNow developer study, watching the full course video from Saasnow on Youtube.
